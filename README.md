# Deep-Learning_AlphabetSoupCharity
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
Use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
Use machine learning and neural networks to implement a model for predicting.

Steps to tackle this problem:

1. Preprocess the data- This step uses upload the data to the jupyter notebook, clean the data using pandas, identiy the target variable,
encoding categorical variables, split the data to train and test data and standardize by creating standarddScheler instance.

2. The second step is- compile, train, and evaluate the mode:

Using TensorFlow, design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Determining the number of neurons based on the number of inputs. Once the number of neurons is determined, compile, train, and evaluate the binary classification model to calculate the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy. 

3. Optimize

Using TensorFlow, optimize the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy
